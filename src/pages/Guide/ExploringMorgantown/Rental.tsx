          We all know that having the right vehicle is so important when we are
          out geocaching. Here in West Virginia, we have a number of geocaches
          that require the use of a kayak and those that are located along
          trails where having a bike make them much quicker to get to. We have
          done our best to try to come up with locations where you can rent
          kayaks and bikes to make your weekend that much more enjoyable.

          The challenge here is that the rental locations are not located at the
          starting or ending point of the kayak trails. This means you would
          have to be able to transport the kayaks to and from the rental
          location. The time it takes to make the trip down river will vary
          based on the geocacher, so even the return time is difficult to
          determine. These same factors apply to bike rentals.

        <Typography>
          We have given you a list of locations where you may possibly be able
          to rent a kayak or a bike. You will need to be able to transport it to
          the caching location and be able to return it to the particular vendor
          according to their rental agreement.
        </Typography>

        <br />

        <Typography>
          We have listed the vendors that we know of in the area who rent, along
          with their phone number and address and it will be up to those who
          decide that is what they would like to do to contact them directly and
          see if they have what they need in their inventory.

          Some have asked if we would have storage space for kayaks and bikes
          that people bring with them. Unfortunately, we do not have the space
          that would be required to store all of the kayaks and bicycles that
          GeoWoodstock attendees will be bringing.

          Friday, May 23, at 9:00 am we will be having a Splash Mob on the

          event. To make this work and get people and kayaks positioned where
          they need to be at the launch site and vehicles for transportation at
          the takeout parking at Prickett's Fort, we are asking people who plan
          to attend the Splash Mob and then geocache their way down river to
          Prickett's Fort to meet at the launch site, N 39° 28.883 W 80° 08.438,
          at 8:00 am. We will leave some people with the kayaks and will need
          others who are willing to transport people back to the launch site to
          get cars after completing the trail to make the trip to Picket's Fort
          and leave their vehicle there and carpool back to the launch, so we
          have vehicle at both ends. By working together, we will get everyone
          reconnected with their vehicles and kayaks.

          Given the number of people who may be going down river we may need to
          launch in groups so that we don't cause too much congestion on the
          water as there will most likely be other boats on the water that
          weekend.
