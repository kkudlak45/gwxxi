          As a result of GeoWoodstock XXI attaining GIGA status, we are
          expecting a large crowd and heavy traffic throughout the weekend. We
          ask that everyone plan ahead, arrive early, and carpool as much as
          possible to help alleviate congestion within Mylan Park. Our goal is
          to accommodate as many guests as quickly and efficiently as possible
          to ensure the best experience possible for all cachers in attendance.{' '}

          The section of Mylan Park Lane between Chaplin Hill Road and Fitness
          Way will be reduced to a one-way flow of traffic. The entrance point
          to Mylan Park will be the SECOND right hand turn into the park as you
          come from I-79, near the Monongalia County bus garage. The right lane
          will be for vehicle traffic to access the main event parking lot, as
          well as additional parking lots at the Monongalia County Bus Garage
          and Pro Performance. The left lane will be closed to vehicle traffic
          and reserved for foot traffic for guests walking to the event from our
          outer parking lots.

            and does not permit non-service animals. The shuttle will run for
            one hour following the closing of HQ on both Friday (5/23) and
            Saturday (5/24). If staying until the end of the event, we recommend

        <Subheader>Entering the main parking lot</Subheader>
        <Typography>
          The main parking lot at the event site is where all VIP and handicap
          parking will be located. Upon turning right into the main lot, guests
          should proceed straight ahead along the full length of the building,
          you will then make a left turn and follow the directions of the
          attendants to either the VIP lot or to the section of the main lot
          reserved for all other guests. Upon exiting, guests will proceed down
          the row the same direction they entered and will join the road to the
          exit. Reaching the exit, guests will turn right to join the one way
          flow of traffic on Mylan Park Lane. We will also have a small amount
          of parking for attendees who have not purchased VIP parking in the
          main lot. Additional parking for non-VIP attendees will be available
          at the Monongalia County Bus Garage and Pro Performance. These lots
          will all be staffed by parking attendants to ensure the safety and
          efficiency of these parking lots. When parking at the Bus Garage or
          Pro Performance parking lots, guests will access the main event by
          walking in the closed lane of Mylan Park Lane. From the Bus garage
          parking lot, it is roughly a quarter mile to the main event and from
          Pro Performance, it is roughly a quarter mile mile walk with a small
          hill to access the main event.

          VIPs and Friends of GeoWoodstock will receive a gold name badge
          lanyard with their registration. When entering the park, please have
          the driver of the vehicle show their gold lanyard to our parking
          attendants to be permitted into the VIP parking area. For this reason,
          we highly encourage all VIPs and Friends of GeoWoodstock to pick up
          their registration during the Friday (5/23) sneak peak from 8 - 10 am.

          parking attendants and show them your VIP confirmation receipt.
          Parking in this area is very limited, so please be honest and help
          make sure we have enough parking spaces for everyone.

          There will be a limited number of accessible parking spaces on a
          first-come, first-served basis. To help us estimate how many ADA
          spaces we may need, please send an email to{' '}
          <a href="mailto:info@GeoWoodstockXXI.com">info@GeoWoodstockXXI.com</a>
          to be added to our list. All individuals with a qualifying handicap
          parking tag or GeoWoodstock ADA pass will be permitted to park in
          these reserved spaces. We are permitting drop-offs at the front
          entrance. Please be advised, there's a lot of walking throughout the
          event center and to the various event locations, so please consider
          bringing a wheelchair, scooter, or other mobility aid if you have
          trouble walking or standing.

        <Typography>
          Once both of these lots fill up, or if you do not wish to walk to the
          event, our additional overflow parking lot will be located at the
          Aquatic Center at Mylan Park. This parking lot will be staffed by a
          shuttle that will run continuously throughout the day to transport
          guests to the main event site. This shuttle will run approximately
          every 20 minutes between the Aquatic Center and main event site.
          Please note, the shuttle is NOT handicap accessible. If you are in
          need of handicap parking, please park in one of the designated spots
          in the main parking lot at the main event site. Dogs are not permitted
          on shuttles.

        <Subheader>Caching in the park</Subheader>
        <Typography>
          To add in the fun, new caches will be published in Mylan Park on
          Friday (5/23). These caches feature 11 unique icons from famous
          cachers such as WVTim and Trycacheus! Some will be located within
          walking distance of the main event, while the rest will be on hiking
          trails near the shuttle parking area. We do not recommend trying to
          drive from cache to cache, but rather park in each area and walk.
          There will be a lot of traffic and congestion throughout the weekend,
          so please be mindful of the Mylan Park community while caching. These
          caches are not park and grabs - if that's what you're looking for,
          please do our <a href="/guide/cryptid">Cryptid Quest geo-art</a>{' '}
          located just outside the park.

        <Typography>
          Last, but most importantly, please be patient. There have been several
          changes at Mylan Park within the past year that has impacted our
          parking capacity. Our team has worked very hard to create the best
          experience possible and ensure enough parking for all attendees, but
          the full logistics are unpredictable. Please adhere to all guidance
          from the parking attendants and be courteous to other cachers
          throughout the weekend.
