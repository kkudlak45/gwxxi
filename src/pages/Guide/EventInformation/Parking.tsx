          As a result of GeoWoodstock XXI attaining GIGA status, we are
          expecting a large crowd and heavy traffic throughout the weekend. We
          ask that everyone plan ahead, arrive early, and carpool as much as
          possible to help alleviate congestion within Mylan Park. Our goal is
          to accommodate as many guests as quickly and efficiently as possible
          to ensure the best experience possible for all cachers in attendance.{' '}

        <Subheader>GETTING TO MYLAN PARK</Subheader>
        <Typography>
          If traveling via Interstate 79, we are strongly encouraging you to get
          off at Exit 152 in Westover and arrive at Mylan Park via Route 19 and
          Chaplin Hill Road. This is not the way your GPS will naturally route
          you, but this is the quickest and easiest way to the park to avoid
          congestion. It is not recommended to get off at exit 155 because of a
          difficult left hand turn on Chaplin Hill Road to access the park.
        </Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography>
          If you are commuting from your hotel in Morgantown, try to avoid
          getting on the Interstate, regardless of what your GPS may tell you to
          believe. You can easily pass through the exit 155 intersection if you
          are coming from the east.

        <Subheader>One-Way information</Subheader>
        <Typography>
          The section of Mylan Park Lane between Chaplin Hill Road and Fitness
          Way will be reduced to a one-way flow of traffic. Please see the
          additional waypoints to navigate to the smaller secondary entrance to
          the park. The right lane will be for vehicle traffic to access the
          main event parking lot, as well as additional parking lots at the
          Monongalia County Bus Garage and Pro Performance. The left lane will
          be closed to vehicle traffic and reserved for foot traffic for guests
          walking to the event from our outer parking lots.

        <Typography>
          The main parking lot at the event site is where all VIP and handicap
          parking will be located. Upon turning right into the main lot, guests
          should proceed straight ahead along the full length of the building,
          you will then make a left turn and follow the directions of the
          attendants to either the VIP lot or to the section of the main lot
          reserved for all other guests. Upon exiting, guests will proceed down
          the row the same direction they entered and will join the road to the
          exit. Reaching the exit, guests will turn right to join the one-way
          flow of traffic on Mylan Park Lane. We will also have a small amount
          of parking for attendees who have not purchased VIP parking in the
          main lot. Additional parking for non-VIP attendees will be available
          at the Monongalia County Bus Garage and Pro Performance. These lots
          will all be staffed by parking attendants to ensure the safety and
          efficiency of these parking lots. When parking at the Bus Garage or
          Pro Performance parking lots, guests will access the main event by
          walking in the closed lane of Mylan Park Lane. From the Bus garage
          parking lot, it is roughly a quarter mile to the main event and from
          Pro Performance, it is roughly a quarter mile walk with a small hill
          to access the main event.

          <a href="mailto:info@GeoWoodstockXXI.com">info@GeoWoodstockXXI.com</a>{' '}

          parking tag or GeoWoodstock ADA pass will be permitted to park in
          these reserved spaces. We are permitting drop-offs at the front
          entrance. The shuttle is not handicap accessible, but for limited
          mobility issues, riding the shuttle is recommended for easy access to
          and from the event venue. Please be advised, there's a lot of walking
          throughout the event center and to the various event locations, so
          please consider bringing a wheelchair, scooter, or other mobility aid

          Once all the general parking lots fill up, or if you do not wish to

          at the Aquatic Center at Mylan Park. This parking lot will be staffed
          by a shuttle that will run continuously throughout the day to
          transport guests to the main event site. This shuttle will run
          approximately every 15 minutes between the Aquatic Center and main
          event site. The shuttle is not handicap accessible, but for limited
          mobility issues, riding the shuttle is recommended for easy access to

          To add in the fun, new caches will be published in Mylan Park on
          Friday (5/23). These caches feature 11 unique icons from famous
          cachers such as WVTim and Trycacheus! Some will be located within
          walking distance of the main event, while the rest will be on hiking
          trails near the shuttle parking area. We do not recommend trying to
          drive from cache to cache, but rather park in each area and walk.
          There will be a lot of traffic and congestion throughout the weekend,
          so please be mindful of the Mylan Park community while caching. These
          caches are not park and grabs - if that's what you're looking for,
          please do our <a href="/guide/cryptid">Cryptid Quest geo-art</a>{' '}

          Last, but most importantly, please be patient. There have been several
          changes at Mylan Park within the past year that has impacted our
          parking capacity. Our team has worked very hard to create the best
          experience possible and ensure enough parking for all attendees, but
          the full logistics are unpredictable. Please adhere to all guidance
          from the parking attendants and be courteous to other cachers
